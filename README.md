## ü§î FAQ

### ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Why Vite and not Next.js, Remix, or Create React App

React updated the official recommendation about how to start a new project. Previously, they recommended Create React App (CRA) and we did [this very same template based on CRA](https://github.com/CodelyTV/cra-template-codely), and right now they recommend to directly use a framework like Next.js, Remix, or Gatsby.

However, they also include an specific section in the official documentation on how to use React without a framework, and the recommended way is to use Vite or Parcel.

Even if not using a framework such as Next.js is something to double check, we are interested into having this template for use cases where you are not interested into the benefits of a complete framework. For instance, theses cases could be as simple as learning the React.js features and limitations in order to have a clear vision where React ends and a framework starts. This is something we do in [our React video course](https://pro.codely.com/library/react-de-0-aplicando-buenas-practicas-192069/460310/about/).

### üëª Why not adding `.vscode` or `.idea` to the `.gitignore` template

These are folders created due to personal environment preferences. We should ignore these personal development environment preferences to be ignored using your global `.gitignore` file and leave the project `.gitignore` file as clean as possible, that is, only containing the project specific rules.

You can create a `.gitignore_global` file with rules that will apply to all your repositories with:

```bash
touch ~/.gitignore_global
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
```
